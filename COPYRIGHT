-----------------------

Withings and related are their trademarks and you can visit their site at
http://withings.com for more information on what they do. I am using their
weighing scale product and found it to be useful.

If you thing that me naming this small utility with withings in the name is
a problem contact me at mail@karthikkrishnan.me and I will change it. It
would be helpful if you could also suggest a cool name (that makes sense
of course) in your email when contacting me ;)

A big thanks to the folk at withings for helping me keep track of my weight.
